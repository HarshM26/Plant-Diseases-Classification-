# Plant Disease Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project focuses on the early classification of plant diseases using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically through the CDL (Convolutional Deep Learning) framework. Accurate and timely identification of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining healthy crops and ensuring food security. This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for training and deploying models to detect and classify diseases in apple and tomato plants using the FieldPlant dataset.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps for cleaning, augmenting, and preparing the FieldPlant dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of the InceptionV3 model for image classification within the CDL framework.
- **Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Scripts and instructions for deploying the trained model to a web application or mobile app for real-time disease detection.

## Datasets

- **FieldPlant Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset with labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, including apple and tomato plants.
